                        <p>While humans have about 9,000 taste buds, cats only have around 470. However, cats have an extra organ in their mouth
                        called the Jacobson's organ, or vomeronasal organ, located inside the nasal cavity and the roof of the mouth, which
                        helps them taste and smell things that are not detected by the normal taste buds.</p>
